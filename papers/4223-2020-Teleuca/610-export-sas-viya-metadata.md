## 1. Create a SAS Viya Job

Access the SAS Job Execution Web Application on your system:
http://your-server/SASJobExecution/

Navigate to the folder location where you want to store your job and then select *New file* from the toolbar:
Specify a name for the file, for example **Get Viya Relationships**, and then select OK. A job definition file is created by default.
Double-click the Get Viya Relationships job definition file and then copy the code from **GetViyaRelationshipsJobDefinition** file.
Select *Save* and then select *Close* to save the job definition file


SAS Job Execution Web Application documentation:

## 2. Create a SAS Viya Job Definition

Right-click on the job definition file and then select *Properties* from the popup menu. 
Expand the Parameters group and then select *Add a new parameter*. 
Create  new parameters with these properties and then select *Save*:

Name Type Default Value Required
_action Character form,execute No
reference_limit Numeric 10000 Yes
relationship_limit Numeric 10000 Yes

The _ACTION parameter specifies that an HTML input form should be displayed as the user interface if available. 
The REFERENCE_LIMIT and RELATIONSHIP_LIMIT parameters limit the number of references and relationships extracted.

Copy paste the content of **GetViyaRelationshipsJobForm**.

Find in the file string, around line 50
<input type="hidden" name="_program"     value="/gelcontent/DM/Demo/Jobs/Get Viya Relationships">

replace */gelcontent/DM/Demo/Jobs/Get Viya Relationships* with the correct path pointing to your Job Definition.

## 3. Execute the SAS Viya Job to Export and Process the Relationships

Access the application using this URL, replace **your-folder-path-to-the-job**:
http://your-server/SASJobExecution/?_program=/your-folder-path-to-the-job/Get Viya Relationships
Specify the required inputs and then select *Run Code* to execute the job.
Check Show Log.

## 4. Results

The job will generate a file with the Viya metadata objects converted to SAS 9 metadata objects. The file is called relationships_to_load.xml. In the job execution window you will see **Click a Link to Download an Item**. You need the **‘Relationships in XML format’** file.
